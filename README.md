# Hospital ERP System: Scalable Cloud-Based Architecture

## Overview
This project outlines a scalable, cost-effective cloud architecture for a multi-hospital ERP system. The solution supports critical modules such as:
- HR Management
- Inventory Management
- Laboratory Information System
- Billing and Financial Management
- Patient Records

The architecture adheres to operational constraints, including:
- Supporting 50 hospitals concurrently.
- A budget limit of â‚¹1200/month per hospital.
- Scalability to handle varying loads efficiently.

## Steps to Replicate the Architecture

### 1. Cloud Provider Setup
Choose a cloud provider such as AWS, Azure, or GCP. Ensure the following services are accessible:
- Compute (e.g., EC2, Azure VMs).
- Storage (e.g., S3, Azure Blob Storage).
- Database (e.g., RDS for MySQL/PostgreSQL, DynamoDB).
- CDN (e.g., AWS CloudFront).
- Monitoring Tools (e.g., AWS CloudWatch).

### 2. Architecture Deployment
1. **Deploy Load Balancers:**
   - Use Elastic Load Balancers (AWS) or equivalent to route traffic to application servers.
2. **Set Up Application Servers:**
   - Use auto-scaling groups with EC2 instances or containerized services.
3. **Configure Database:**
   - Deploy relational databases (RDS) for structured data.
   - Use a NoSQL solution for unstructured data, if needed.
4. **Implement Caching:**
   - Set up Redis/Memcached for faster data retrieval.
5. **Enable CDN:**
   - Distribute static assets using AWS CloudFront or Azure CDN.
6. **Add Monitoring and Logging:**
   - Integrate tools for real-time monitoring and logs (e.g., CloudWatch, Prometheus).

### 3. Optimization Recommendations
- Use spot or reserved instances for cost efficiency.
- Enable auto-scaling for dynamic resource allocation.
- Implement caching to reduce database queries.
- Use a CDN to optimize asset delivery.
